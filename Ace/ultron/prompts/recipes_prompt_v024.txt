Chicken Fried Rice Recipe:

Ingredients:
- 2 cups cooked white rice (preferably a day old or chilled)
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, and green beans)
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce (or to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:

1. If you're using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a baking sheet or plate and let it cool for about 30 minutes. This will help prevent it from getting mushy during the stir-frying process.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are no longer pink inside (about 4-5 minutes). Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
